\small
 The goal of this competition is not to improve the Search Engine of Home Depot. 
\\ The aim is to design a tool that lets to \textbf{evaluate the quality of a search engine algorithm}. \\Home Depot is using the search relevancy to qualify the quality of a new algorithm. For some queries on the Home Depot website, the IR systems is outputing some particular Home DepoT product and \textbf{several human raters} to give a grade betwen 1 and 3 to judge the revelancy of the product according to the query. 
\\The aim of the competition is to try to \textbf{automatize this judging process}. It will hep to increase the number of search engine algorithms that Home Depot is able to test.

The task is thus to try to mimick the process made by a human rater to judge the quality of an output according to a particular query. For the task, we are provided several datasets: 
\begin{itemize}
\item the instructions given to a human rater 
\item some \textbf{descriptions of the different products} and some additional informations
\item\textbf{a training set} where we have access to the average grade given by a judge to a pair query-product returned by the algorithm
\item a test set where we need to \textbf{predict the relevance score for a particular pair query-product}
\end{itemize}
